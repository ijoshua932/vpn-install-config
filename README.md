</p>
<p>
First open your browser and type www.protonvpn.com and look for the corresponding software download for your machine, in this case it's Windows 10. Proton is also avaliable for MacOS and Linux, as well as mobile devices such as iPhone/iPad and Androids.

</p>
<p>
After downloading and installing the software just wait, depending on your internet connection it can take a minute or two.

</p>
<p>
Once it's installed create an account, if you don't already have one. You might have to complete a captcha in order to create or login to your account.

<p>
A good reference to find your IP address is www.whatismyipaddress.com if you don't know what it is. As seen here, I show my IPv4 address before connecting to a VPN server in the Netherlands.

</p>
<p>
Here you can see my IP address and the available VPN servers. With the free version of Proton, you get access to servers in three different countries. If you want access to more servers and countries you're going to need a paid subscription.

</p>
<p>
After connecting to a server in the Netherlands, you can see that my IP address has changed. You can also see the current capacity of the server and the upload and download speeds in kilobytes per second.

</p>
<p>
After you have connected to the server, you can go back to www.whatismyipaddress.com and either refresh the page or open and new tab of the home page and see that you are connected.

</p>
<p>
If you open your browser and go to www.google.com you will see that the website is in Dutch. And that's how you will know you are still connected to the VPN.
